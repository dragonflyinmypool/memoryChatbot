Update
Software Project Tracking
What’s Been Improved:
Easier Posting: Projects are now simpler to log.
Acknowledgement by Stratten/Baobab: Ensures that tasks are recognized and visible so we know they are being addressed.
Time Estimation: Tracks how long tasks are expected to take and lets us check if they are being handled on schedule.
Categorization: Projects are grouped as "Issue," "Feature," or "Project" to prioritize issues and allow anyone to quickly understand the tracker at a glance.





Stratten’s Team Commitment
Why are projects taking so long? How can we speed it up? Number of hours are you dedicating to CC?
Weekly allocation of 15 hours for $1,700 (including Baobab’s team) translates to:
Hourly: ~$110
Monthly: $7,200
Yearly: ~$86,000 (for less than half-time)
Would benefit from pre-planning down by our team (send him over the detailed info)
Other Baobab employees are not very helpful / seem like a waste of time..
Conclusion: limited hours, limited headspace => long term should move away from Stratten. But step by step. For now he is reliable and knowledgeable.



Role Differentiation: SF Admin vs. Developer
It’s important to separate these two roles, though they can sometimes overlap:
Admin:
Permissions & Security: Essential to avoid errors and protect sensitive data. Currently, everyone is set as a system admin, which is risky and needs fixing immediately.
Page Layouts: Adjust layouts (e.g., accounts, services, opportunities) to suit specific department needs.
Reports & Dashboards: Create and optimize them for better clarity and insight.
Database Cleaning: Ensure data accuracy, remove duplicates, and document usage.
Automation: Use Flows to streamline repetitive tasks.
Staff Training: Train team members to use Salesforce effectively.
Day-to-Day Support: Resolve user issues and enhance workflows as needed.
General Admin Work:
Google Workspace: Manage permissions and settings.
QuickBooks: Handle roles and access control.
Other tools as required.
Developer:
Troubleshoot and refine custom software.
Build new features and workflows.
Integrate Salesforce with tools like QuickBooks and other external platforms.


Next steps
Take Over Admin Role:
Focus on tasks that don’t require Stratten’s direct involvement, such as permissions, page layouts, and optimization.
Run all changes by Stratten to ensure alignment with his work.
Establish Permissions and Security:
Restrict access to critical settings in Salesforce (e.g., database, user roles).
Create profile-based permissions for different departments (e.g., Sales, Finance, Support).
Permission and security for other accounts:
Google Drive: Create departmental folders with access restricted to relevant teams (e.g., finance-only folders for management and finance staff).
QuickBooks: Review and adjust user roles, limiting access to sensitive features like adding/removing users.
Database Audits and Cleanup:
Go over each object => who is the "owner" what is it used for, keep a list.
What connections are made.
Document usage, identify outdated information, and clean up databases across platforms.
Standardize and streamline information for better efficiency.
Optimize Salesforce based on newly created profiles:
Improving page layouts, 
Reports 
Dashboards
Plan for Long-Term Efficiency:
Gradually reduce reliance on Stratten for admin tasks, freeing him to focus on development.
Maintain transparency by running admin changes by Stratten to avoid conflicts with his work.



Additional Suggestions
Weekly Check-Ins: Regular phone or in-person updates to ensure alignment and handle bottlenecks.
Improve Collaboration Tools:
Use Google Chat for team discussions (threads, spaces, notifications) while keeping email and Salesforce Chatter for task-specific communication.
Reassign Office Tasks:
Have someone like Berach take over office supply management from Adele, as she’s remote and already overloaded.
Support for Natan:
Consider a part-time assistant bookkeeper to give Natan more control and oversight over finance.
